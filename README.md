# dymiumCore

<img src="man/figures/dymium-banner.png" align="centre" />

**dymiumCore** is an R package which provides a toolbox for developing a
microsimulation model. While the core focus of the package is for
modelling urban systems, dymium can be easily extended to apply in other
contexts as well.

# Why `dymiumCore`?

  - written in R
  - easy to setup
  - ready-to-use events see
    [dymium-org/dymiumModules](https://github.com/dymium-org/dymiumModules)
  - microsimulation events are modular, sharable and scalable
  - equipped with the basic building blocks for building a
    microsimulation model that is flexible and extensible.
  - can use parameters from various model objects (e.g.Â `stats::lm`,
    `stats::glm`, `caret::train`).

## Installation

`dymiumCore` is not available on CRAN. You can install directly from
GitHub using `remotes`:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("dymium-org/dymiumCore")
```

to see the available modules.

## An example project

We have recently setup an example project so that you can see our
package in action\! Please visit
[dymium-org/dymiumExampleProject](https://github.com/dymium-org/dymiumExampleProject)
to learn more about it.

## Collaboration

We are open to collaboration on this project. If you are interested,
please email us at amarin at dymium.org.

## Development plan (as of 11th Jan 2020)

  - [x] **Version 0.1.0**: (21 Jan 2020) Releases all the basic building
    blocks for microsimulation modelling.
  - [ ] **Version 0.2.0**: Implements model-based calibration.
  - [ ] **Version 0.3.0**: Visualisation functions for life-courses,
    spatial data, etc.
  - [ ] **Version 0.4.0**: Integration with dymiumGUI.
