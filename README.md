# dymiumCore <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" alt="" width="120" />

**dymiumCore** is an R package which provides a toolbox for developing a
microsimulation model that is modular and pipable. While the core focus
of the package is for modelling urban systems, dymium can be easily
extended to apply in other contexts as well.

## Installation

The dymiumCore package has not been released on CRAN, but you can
install from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("dymium-org/dymiumCore")
```

## Development plan (as of 11th Jan 2020)

  - **Version 0.1.0**: Releases all the basic building blocks for
    microsimulation modelling.
  - **Version 0.2.0**: Implements model-based calibration.
  - **Version 0.3.0**: Visualisation functions for life-courses, spatial
    data, etc.
  - **Version 0.4.0**: Integration with dymiumGUI.
