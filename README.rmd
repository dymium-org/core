# dymiumCore: <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" alt="" width="120" />

**dymiumCore** is an R package which provides a toolbox for developing a microsimulation model that is modular and pipable. While the core focus of the package is for modelling urban systems, dymium can be easily extended to apply in other contexts as well.

## Available modules

Please visit [dymium-org/dymiumModules](https://github.com/dymium-org/dymiumModules) to see available modules.

## Structure

The main building blocks of microsimulation are agents, environment and models.

## Currently supported models

Currently, dymiumCore we only support model objects fitted using the `caret` package.

| Package |     Class |                                     Model types |         status |
| ------: | --------: | ----------------------------------------------: | -------------: |
|   caret |   `train` |            classification and regression models |      supported |
|  mlogit |  `mlogit` |                        multinomial logit models | in-development |
|    mlr3 | `Learner` | classification, survival, and regression models |        planned |

__Note that__: data.frames and named lists can be used in the model argument of a Transition object. 

- If a `data.frame` is provided, it must contain a key column or keys columns and must have a column named 'prob' that must be a numeric type with values within [0,1] which represent probability values. Recently, models of type data.table have gained a new support where multiple choices can be simulated using a data.table object as a model. The data.table object should contains matching variables and two extra columns which are `prob`, a list column of numeric vectors, and `choice`, also a list column but contains character vectors.

- A named `list` can be used to represent choices, where names of the list are choices and values are their associated probabilities.
