# dymiumCore

<img src="man/figures/dymium-banner.png" align="centre" />

**dymiumCore** is an R package which provides a toolbox for developing a microsimulation model. While the core focus of the package is for modelling urban systems, dymium can be easily extended to apply in other contexts as well.

# Why another microsimulation framework?

It is true that there is no shortage of open source microsimulation frameworks, but many of the existing ones often use a platform that doesn't support data analysis as good as R, or use a programming langauge that many modellers may be unfamiliar with. Hence, those frameworks would not be the first choice for many modellers who are interested in microsimulation modelling but lack the programming skills or time to learn a programming langauge that is foreign and has no other benefits to them. The main philosophy of `dymiumCore` is to use the power of existing R packages to create functions and classes that are the basic building blocks of any microsimulation model, in general, and to allow an entire workflow from data preparation, model estimation, microsimulation, calibration to visualisation within only the R environment, where many other frameworks do not offer. This enhances reproducibility and maintainability of your microsimulation model and allow others to build on your work more easily.

# Why `dymiumCore`?

- written in R
- easy to setup
- ready-to-use events see [dymium-org/dymiumModules](https://github.com/dymium-org/dymiumModules)
- microsimulation events are modular, sharable and scalable
- equipped with the basic building blocks for building a microsimulation model that is flexible and extensible.
- can use parameters from various model objects (e.g. `stats::lm`, `stats::glm`, `caret::train`).

## Installation

`dymiumCore` is not available on CRAN. You can install directly from GitHub using `remotes`:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("dymium-org/dymiumCore")
```
