# dymiumCore

<img src="man/figures/dymium-banner.png" align="centre" />

**dymiumCore** is an R package which provides a toolbox for developing a microsimulation model. While the core focus of the package is for modelling urban systems, dymium can be easily extended to apply in other contexts as well.

# Why `dymiumCore`?

- written in R
- easy to setup
- ready-to-use events see [dymium-org/dymiumModules](https://github.com/dymium-org/dymiumModules)
- microsimulation events are modular, sharable and scalable
- equipped with the basic building blocks for building a microsimulation model that is flexible and extensible.
- can use parameters from various model objects (e.g. `stats::lm`, `stats::glm`, `caret::train`).

## Installation

`dymiumCore` is not available on CRAN. You can install directly from GitHub using `remotes`:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("dymium-org/dymiumCore")
```
